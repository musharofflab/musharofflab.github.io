                        <b>
                           We welcome applications from prospective students and postdocs. The Musharoff Lab strives to 
                           support diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. Applications from underrepresented groups 
                           in science are especially encouraged. We believe science is best advanced when all voices contribute!
                        </b><br>
                        
                        We are excited that you're considering joining our lab! Based at Cornell University’s 
                        main campus in Ithaca, New York, the Musharoff Lab is committed to fostering a collaborative, 
                        inclusive, and intellectually stimulating environment where scientists at all levels can thrive. 
                        Our goal is to equip lab members with the skills, knowledge, and confidence 
                        to embark on successful careers, whether in academia, industry, or beyond.<br>

                        Our lab is currently located in the 102 suite of Weill Hall, but we will be moving to Atkinson Hall, 
                        Cornell’s newest LEED Gold-certified building, upon its completion in January 2025.<br>

                           <p>
                              We are always on the lookout for motivated postdoctoral fellows eager to explore 
                              innovative research questions in computational genomics, machine learning applications 
                              in genetics, and population genetics. If you have a background in one of these areas 
                              (or related fields like statistics, computer science, or bioinformatics) and are interested 
                              in joining us, please email Dr. Musharoff (sam442 at cornell edu).
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Please include a CV, a brief research statement (1-2 pages) outlining your experience and 
                              future interests, including potential projects you'd like to pursue in the lab, and the 
                              contact information for 2-3 references. Please use "Postdoc Application" as the subject line. 
                              We review applications on a rolling basis and are open to discussing potential start dates 
                              and collaborations.

                           <h4>PhD and Master's Students</h4>

                           <p>
                              At Cornell, graduate study is organized through Graduate Fields—groups of faculty and 
                              students with similar interests that span departments across campus. The Musharoff Lab 
                              accepts graduate students through two fields: Computational Biology (CB) and Genetics, 
                              Genomics, and Development (GGD). Master’s students from other programs interested in 
                              research within these areas are also encouraged to apply. <br>

                              I encourage you to explore the requirements, deadlines, and faculty and student interests 
                              within each graduate field to determine which is the best fit for your background and goals. 
                              <a href="https://gradschool.cornell.edu/admissions/degrees-fields/cugradfos/">You can find 
                              more information on the respective graduate field pages</a>. <br>

                              While admissions decisions are handled by the fields, I welcome pre-application inquiries. 
                              Please email me with "Graduate Application Inquiry" in the subject line, and include your 
                              CV and a brief description of your research interests. We can discuss how your interests align 
                              with ongoing projects in the lab and which field might be the best fit.

                              Rotation students from a variety of programs are welcome to explore our lab. If you’re part of a 
                              life sciences, computer science, or related graduate program and would like to work with us during 
                              a rotation, reach out to discuss available projects. Our lab covers a broad range of topics, and 
                              rotation projects can be tailored to your background. Please email me directly with "Rotation Inquiry" 
                              in the subject line, and attach your CV.

                           <p>
                              We are always eager to bring undergraduate students into the lab, whether for independent research 
                              projects or to assist on ongoing studies. No prior experience is required, but familiarity with 
                              coding (Python, R, or C++) and enthusiasm for learning are beneficial. If you’re interested, 
                              send an email with the subject "Undergraduate Research Inquiry," along with your CV, relevant coursework, 
                              and a brief statement of your research interests. We’ll find ways for you to contribute to our research 
                              while helping you build the skills necessary for your future career.
