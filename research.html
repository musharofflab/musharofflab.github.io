                        Our lab emphasizes integrating data from both human and non-human populations to understand the mechanisms 
                        behind genomic variation and its implications for health disparities. We focus on factors such as admixture, 
                        gene-environment interactions, and demographic structures that influence disease risk. Utilizing statistical 
                        and computational methods, we investigate complex traits and develop techniques for inferring demographic 
                        histories and analyzing deleterious variation. Additionally, we aim to promote the equitable inclusion of 
                        underrepresented populations in genomics, thereby enriching our insights into genetic diversity and 
                        trait architecture.

                              Current research efforts in defining genetic variation and disease risk in diverse populations focus on 
                              addressing the underrepresentation of non-European ancestries in genomic studies. The limitations of 
                              existing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have highlighted the need for tailored models that consider 
                              genetic diversity. By leveraging large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) and integrating 
                              data from diverse populations, researchers aim to refine risk assessments for complex diseases, thereby 
                              enhancing the applicability of genetic findings across different demographic groups. To further enhance 
                              understanding, studies are increasingly incorporating Electronic Health Records (EHRs) 
                              to link genetic data with clinical outcomes, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of genetic risk factors 
                              in real-world settings. Machine learning algorithms for model refinement are being employed to improve 
                              predictive accuracy. By fostering inclusivity in genetic research, these efforts aim to develop more effective 
                              precision medicine strategies, ultimately addressing health disparities and promoting equitable healthcare for 
                              diverse populations.

                              Research in population genetics and statistical genetics has advanced significantly, focusing 
                              on methods to understand population structure and genetic diversity. Genetic data collected from 
                              millions of individuals across various populations is being utilized to broaden our understanding 
                              of genetic relationships within and among populations. Notable developments include the Structure 
                              software for model-based clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reveal geographic patterns, 
                              and the use of coalescent theory and Hidden Markov Models to estimate recombination rates and ancestry 
                              patterns. Projects in the Musharoff lab address population structure, demographic influences, and 
                              the interplay of selection and history, facilitating insights into human evolutionary dynamics.

                              Gene-environment (GxE) research delves into the intricate interactions between genetic and environmental 
                              factors that influence traits. Rather than viewing traits as simple additive combinations of genetic and 
                              environmental components, this field acknowledges that complex relationships define them. Gene-gene 
                              interactions (GxG), including epistasis, complicate the understanding of trait variance, while GxE 
                              interactions reveal how specific environmental contexts can either amplify or mitigate genetic effects.
                              Moreover, gene-environment correlations (rGE) illustrate how genetic predispositions can shape an individual's 
                              environmental exposures, leading to feedback loops that affect traits across generations. Ongoing research 
                              in the Musharoff lab focuses on refining models to better capture these dynamic interactions, aiming to 
                              enhance our understanding of the multifaceted nature of traits and their development.
